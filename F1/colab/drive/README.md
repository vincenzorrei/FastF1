# F1/colab/drive/ - Google Drive Data and Artifacts Structure

This directory, when mirrored on your Google Drive at the location specified by `base_project_drive_path` in `F1/colab/configs/colab_path_config.yaml`, serves as the root for all data, models, logs, and artifacts generated by or used by the Colab-based F1 project pipeline.

## Expected Subdirectory Structure:

The Colab scripts and notebooks will expect the following subdirectories to exist within this `drive` directory (e.g., `/content/drive/My Drive/path/to/your/FASTF1/F1/colab/drive/`). Scripts are generally designed to create these directories if they don't exist, but it's good practice to understand the structure.

*   **`artifacts/`**:
    *   Stores supplementary materials generated during the pipeline, such as:
        *   Scalers (`.joblib` or `.pkl`)
        *   Encoders (`.pkl`)
        *   Evaluation plots (e.g., confusion matrices, ROC curves)
        *   Evaluation reports (`.txt`, `.csv`, or `.md`)
        *   Feature importance plots/data.

*   **`fastf1_cache_colab/`**:
    *   Used by FastF1 for caching API responses if configured to use Google Drive for persistence.
    *   Note: Caching to Google Drive can be slow.

*   **`feature_engineered_data/`**:
    *   Contains datasets after feature engineering has been applied.
    *   Typically, a `featured_dataset.parquet` file.

*   **`logs/`**:
    *   General directory for log files from various pipeline stages.
    *   **`training_logs/`**: Subdirectory specifically for detailed logs from model training (e.g., epoch-by-epoch metrics).
    *   Individual log files like `colab_pipeline.log`, `colab_data_extraction.log`, etc., as defined in `colab_path_config.yaml`.

*   **`model_input/`**:
    *   Stores data prepared specifically for model training and evaluation, such as:
        *   Sequence data (e.g., `X_train.npy`, `y_train_change.npy`, `y_train_type.npy`)
        *   Split data indices or identifiers.

*   **`models/`**:
    *   Stores trained model files (e.g., `.pth` for PyTorch models).
    *   May include model checkpoints.

*   **`processed_data/`**:
    *   Contains consolidated and cleaned datasets ready for feature engineering.
    *   Typically, a `dataset.parquet` file and a `consolidation_report.txt`.

*   **`raw_data/`**:
    *   Stores raw data fetched from FastF1, organized by year and event.
    *   Example: `raw_data/2023/Bahrain_Grand_Prix/Bahrain_Grand_Prix_R_data.parquet`

*   **`data_download_log.csv`**:
    *   A CSV file at the root of this `drive` directory, logging the status of data downloads from FastF1.

## Configuration:

All paths to these directories are defined and should be managed through `F1/colab/configs/colab_path_config.yaml`. Ensure the `base_project_drive_path` in that configuration file correctly points to the parent `FASTF1` project directory on your Google Drive.
