# Instructions for setting up the Colab Environment

## 1. Mount Google Drive
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

## 2. Navigate to Project Directory
# Adjust the path to where your 'FASTF1/F1/colab/' directory is located in your Google Drive.
# For example, if your project root 'FASTF1' is in 'My Drive/Colab Notebooks/FASTF1',
# then the path would be '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/FASTF1/F1/colab/'
# It's crucial to set this path correctly.

# Example:
# %cd '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/FASTF1/F1/colab/'

# Placeholder - USER MUST UPDATE THIS PATH:
# %cd '/content/drive/My Drive/path/to/your/FASTF1/F1/colab/'


## 3. Install Dependencies
# Ensure 'requirements.txt' is in the current directory (e.g., F1/colab/)
# The command should be run from the directory containing requirements.txt

!pip install -r requirements.txt

## 4. Verify Installations (Optional)
# You can add import statements for key libraries to verify they were installed correctly.
# Example:
# import fastf1
# import pandas
# import torch
# print(f"FastF1 version: {fastf1.__version__}")
# print(f"Pandas version: {pandas.__version__}")
# print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")

## Notes:
# - Ensure the Colab runtime has GPU enabled if you plan to use it for model training.
# - The `%cd` command is a magic command in IPython environments (like Colab) to change directory.
# - The path to `requirements.txt` in the `!pip install` command assumes you have navigated
#   to the `F1/colab/` directory where `requirements.txt` is located.
#   If running from a different base path, adjust accordingly (e.g., `!pip install -r F1/colab/requirements.txt`).
